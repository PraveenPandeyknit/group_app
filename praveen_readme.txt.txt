This application is partially developed which can be used to do some processes. Afer setting up the ruby and rails and mysql one will have to create the seed data and the tables using scripts as mentioned below in this file.

There was some issue in running the migration due to which I had to create the tables and data manually.


--Seed scripts to create tables and seed data are written in:
	\db\create_table_data.sql

--Homepage contains four links to do below actions:
1- To display list of departments
2- To display list of employees
3- To display list of groups with users present
4- To create a group of first registered employee from each depoartment.
